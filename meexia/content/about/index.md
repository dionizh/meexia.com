# Previous Lives

- I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia and never left the island of Java 
in the first 17 years of my life.

- In the midst of what was similar to a civil war, my parents sent me to 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where I lived for 15 months. I did not speak English
before this.

- Eventually my whole family (parents and 2 younger brothers) and I moved to 
Australia. I went back and forth between Melbourne and Sydney. Australia is
the country I call home.

- I received a scholarship to do a year of Game Programming study in Vancouver, 
and convinced my parents to pay the rest. So I took a year off Uni and 
flew across the world with $15,000 notes sewn by my dad on the inside of my jeans.

- I did the whole 'backpacking around South East Asia' for several weeks and
came back with limbs full of bed bugs bites, which took months to clear off.

- I flew to Singapore with two suitcases and came back with a husband.

- I was married to my high school sweetheart for 10 years, before realising we just liked
the story more than anything. People still tell me how good the story is.

- London was the 7th city that I lived in. What was supposed to be a year gig
turned into a decade of love affair.

- I've changed my name (not because of marriage), I've changed nationality
and added another one. All in all, I have had 2 names and 3 nationalities.
