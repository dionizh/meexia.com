# Games

Just recently my 8 years old nephew asked about the games I 'made'. He was
being very kind, considering these games were out before he was even born,
and the consoles they were made for are not around anymore. He knew what
PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS were, though I don't think he knew GameCube.

I worked for about 4 years in video games industry, at a company in Melbourne
which was bought by THQ and is now defunct. I then had a short stint at a 
startup in Singapore, before joining Lucasfilm Singapore, to work on the first 
game project in the Singapore studio. The games I worked on:

- Nicktoons Unite! (2005)
- Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island (2006)
- Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Jedi Alliance (2008)

I watched the entire three seasons of SpongeBob (plus some Danny Phantom
and The Fairly OddParents) when I began working on the Nicktoons games.
I also watched the entire Star Wars movies when I began working on the Clone
Wars game (no I never watched them before that). Because research.
