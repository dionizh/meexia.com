# Visual Effects (VFX)

I worked in VFX industry for nearly 12 years in London (Framestore)
and Sydney (Animal Logic) as a Pipeline TD.

The movies that I got credits on:

In reality I worked on a lot more movies and never got credited (it's a tricky
thing). There were too many movies to mention, but some notable
ones - those I liked and felt I contributed to:

- [Edge of Tomorrow](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/) (2014)
- [Doctor Strange](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1211837/) (2016)
- [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3183660) (2016)
- [Beauty and the Beasts](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771200/) (2017)
- [Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/) (2017)
- [Thor: Ragnarok](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/) (2017)
- [Paddington 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4468740/) (2017)
- [Christopher Robin](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4575576/) (2018)
- [Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4123430/) (2018)
- [Mowgli](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2388771/) (2018)
- [Avengers: Endgame](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154796/) (2019)
- [Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5884052/) (2019)
- [His Dark Materials (Season 1)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5607976/) (2019)

These used to be on IMDb, but they removed me completely at some point and 
there was no way for me to re-add my credits back nor contact their customer 
support, so I was just gone for months or years until they decided to finally
add *one* of my credits back. So I'm done with getting IMDb up to date. Consider 
this page the source of truth. You could even check the credits on those movies 
yourself!
